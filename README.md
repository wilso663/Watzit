### Watzit? Memory Game

## What is it?
The Watzit? Memory Game is a small memory card game where you try to match card face pairs by flipping over the watzit cards. 
Originally, this react project was created as an exercise for myself to become more familiar with event bubbling and React Lifecycle methods as well as css animations.
As a React project, I aimed to use hook functional methods for useState and useEffect since they were new concepts to me. My previous react experience revolved around
componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate methods.

Rules
------
Only two cards can be flipped over at a time. 
Flipping over two cards that aren't a match will reset them to their face down position. 
Flipping over two cards that match will keep them in their face up position. 
The objective is to get all of the cards to face up by remembering where the face down card matches occur.  
Find all of the matches to win.
